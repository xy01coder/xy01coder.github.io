        <section>
            <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect or transmit any data, there's no risk of data breaches through network communication. All your voice recordings and settings are securely stored on your own device and protected by your device's operating system security measures.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>VoiceMinder is designed for general use. The app is not directed at children under 13, nor do we knowingly collect personal information from children. In fact, since we don't collect any information, this is naturally guaranteed.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. User Rights</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect any data, traditional data rights (such as access, deletion, modification) don't apply here. However, you can always:</p>
