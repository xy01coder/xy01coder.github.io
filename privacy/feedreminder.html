        <section>
            <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong></p>
            <p>FeedingTimer is designed to operate completely locally on your device, which means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No collection of any user data</li>
                <li>No internet connectivity required</li>

                <li>All feeding records and settings are stored locally on your device</li>
                <li>No analytics or tracking of any kind</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. App Permissions</h2>
            <p>FeedingTimer requires the following system permissions to function properly:</p>

            <h3>Notification Permissions</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send feeding time reminders at scheduled intervals</li>
                <li>Display alarm notifications when it's time to feed</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These permissions are only used to deliver feeding reminders to you. We never use notifications for advertising or promotional purposes.</p>

            <h3>Alarm & Background Permissions</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Schedule alarms to trigger at specific times</li>
                <li>Ensure alarms work even when the app is closed</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
            <p>FeedingTimer only stores the following information locally on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Feeding time records (timestamp of each feeding)</li>
                <li>Your configured feeding interval setting</li>
                <li>App preferences (alarm sound, volume, etc.)</li>
                <li>Next scheduled feeding time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All this information is stored on your device through the operating system's local storage and is never transmitted elsewhere. The app stores up to 100 feeding records automatically.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>FeedingTimer does not use any third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or other external services. The app operates completely offline and does not communicate with any servers.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect or transmit any data, there's no risk of data breaches through network communication. All your feeding records and settings are securely stored on your own device and protected by your device's operating system security measures.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>FeedingTimer is designed for use by parents and caregivers. The app is not directed at children under 13, nor do we knowingly collect personal information from children. In fact, since we don't collect any information, this is naturally guaranteed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>If we make significant changes to this privacy policy, we will notify you through app updates. Given FeedingTimer's core design for privacy protection, we don't anticipate feature changes that would require data collection.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. User Rights</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect any data, traditional data rights (such as access, deletion, modification) don't apply here. However, you can always:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>View and manage your feeding records within the app</li>
                <li>Delete individual feeding records by swiping left</li>
                <li>Modify your preferences through in-app settings</li>
                <li>Completely uninstall the app to remove all local data</li>
                <li>Revoke notification permissions to stop receiving reminders</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>10. Data Export and Deletion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Export:</strong> Currently, the app does not support exporting feeding records. All data remains on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all feeding records and settings from your device.</li>
            </ul>
