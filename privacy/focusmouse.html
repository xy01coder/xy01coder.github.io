            <strong>Quick Summary:</strong> FocusMouse fully respects your privacy. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>FocusMouse is a macOS utility that helps users quickly switch mouse focus between multiple monitors. We are committed to protecting your privacy, and this privacy policy explains how we handle your information.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong></p>
            <p>FocusMouse is designed to operate completely locally, which means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No collection of any user data</li>
                <li>No internet connectivity</li>
                <li>No information sent to any third parties</li>
                <li>All settings and configurations are stored locally on your device</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. App Permissions</h2>
            <p>FocusMouse requires the following system permissions to function properly:</p>

            <h3>Accessibility Permissions</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monitor global hotkeys that you configure</li>
                <li>Control mouse cursor movement between displays</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> While accessibility permissions technically allow apps to access interface elements of other applications, FocusMouse never reads or records any of your activities in other apps. We only use these permissions to listen for hotkeys and control mouse position.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
            <p>FocusMouse only stores the following configuration information locally on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your configured hotkey combinations</li>
                <li>App preferences (such as launch at startup)</li>
                <li>Display configuration information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All this information is stored on your device through macOS's UserDefaults system and is never transmitted elsewhere.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>FocusMouse does not use any third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or other external services. The app operates completely offline.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect any data, there's no risk of data breaches. All your configuration information is securely stored on your own device and protected by macOS system-level security measures.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>FocusMouse is not specifically targeted at children under 13, nor do we knowingly collect personal information from children. In fact, since we don't collect any information, this is naturally guaranteed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>If we make significant changes to this privacy policy, we will notify you through app updates. Given FocusMouse's core design for privacy protection, we don't anticipate feature changes that would require additional data collection.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. User Rights</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect any data, traditional data rights (such as access, deletion, modification) don't apply here. However, you can always:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modify your preferences through in-app settings</li>
                <li>Completely uninstall the app to remove all local configurations</li>
                <li>Revoke accessibility permissions to stop app functionality</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
